# Refactor-1

This Project had me make super awesome mega changes on a HTML and CSS Doc, essentially simplifying the coding to make it easier to read and give it more of a flow to it.
Added Semantic tags to it to, because why not it's the way of the future.

Request for this Refactor:
"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines" - Suspicious Man in the Alleyway

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title" - Also Suspicious Man in the Alleyway

He told me the above assuming that it was some sort of riddle, couldn't make it out though.

Things that went well:
Really enjoyed citing the semantic tags to the project, giving a professional touch to it.
Cleaned up a mess of a code, and made it a well organized mess, it feels alot smaller to.
The HTML code can honestly be read entirely without having to go to the page, but it lacks the creative touch that the full website has.

things that went poorly:
I ran out of ice tea half way through and I had to go to the store to get more.
The docuement really hurt my eyes upon first inspection, I thought my inital code was messing..
I should definitely get into a better mindset of organization, but I'm getting better with each new website I make.
